# Plentymarkets Delivery Slip Plugin

The Plentymarkets Delivery Slip Plugin is a custom integration solution designed to automate the handling of delivery slips and integrate with third-party logistics and customs providers. This plugin reacts to specific events triggered within Plentymarkets and sends API requests to external endpoints based on configurable settings.

## Features

- **Label Generation:** Enable or disable the generation of labels for delivery slips.
- **Debug URL:** Specify an HTTP URL for debugging API requests related to delivery slip events.
- **Attributes Management:** Add custom attributes (`Shipment ID` and `Tracking Code`) to delivery orders.
- **Event Handling:** Reacts to the creation of delivery slips and sends data to `/label` or `/shipment` endpoints based on configuration.
- **PDF Generation:** Generates PDF documents for delivery slips and associates them with orders.
